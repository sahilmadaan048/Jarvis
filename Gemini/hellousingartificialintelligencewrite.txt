Prompt: hello using artificial intelligence write

Response:
Okay, I understand. You want me to write something *using* Artificial Intelligence. The thing is, *I* am the AI. So everything I write is, by definition, written using AI.

To give you a more meaningful response, I need a little more information.  What specifically do you want me to write?  For example, do you want:

*   **A poem?** (Give me a subject or theme.)
*   **A short story?** (Give me a genre, some characters, a plot point.)
*   **A technical explanation?** (Tell me what topic you want explained.)
*   **A script for a commercial?** (Tell me what product or service.)
*   **An email?** (Tell me the recipient and the purpose.)
*   **A song?** (Give me a genre, mood, and perhaps a title or a first line.)
*   **Code?** (Tell me the language and purpose.)
*   **A blog post?** (Give me the topic and target audience.)
*   **A response to a specific prompt or question?** (Give me the prompt!)

The more information you give me, the better I can tailor my response to your needs.  I'm ready!  Let me know what you'd like me to write.
